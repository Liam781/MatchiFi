A team of 5 contributed to the development of this program. A collaboration between Computer Science practitioners and Finance professionals. 

MatchiFi fetches data from users through a UI by prompting users to enter the relevant data points which are then stored in an SQL database.
The program then fetches data from the database, converts it into a pandas dataframe to be fed into the ML model. It then returns a response.
